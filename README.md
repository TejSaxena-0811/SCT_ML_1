# SCT_ML_1
This repository contains a house price prediction project that utilizes linear regression with polynomial features. The project is implemented using a scikit-learn pipeline to streamline the preprocessing steps, including scaling and feature transformation. The model's performance is evaluated using cross-validation, mean squared error, and R-squared metrics. Visualizations, including residual and predicted vs. actual price plots, are also provided to analyze the model's predictions.

Key Features:<br>
<br>
Data Preprocessing: Standard scaling and polynomial feature transformation.<br>
Modeling: Linear regression with second-degree polynomial features.<br>
Evaluation: Cross-validation with R-squared scoring, Mean Squared Error, and R-squared metrics.<br>
Visualizations: Residual plot and predicted vs. actual prices plot for model performance analysis.<br>
